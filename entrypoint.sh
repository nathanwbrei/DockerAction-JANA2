# This is run from within the temporary janatest container
# that gets built by GitHub as part of a GitHub Action to test
# pull requests and commits to master.
#
# This builds JANA2 using the branch given by the GITHUB_REF
# environment variable (passed in by GitHub when container
# is run). What actually gets passed is not the branch
# name, but a repository reference from GITHUB_REF that looks
# something like "refs/pull/61/merge". This gets fetched from the
# origin into a branch named "CI" which is then checked out.
#
# This also uses the CXX_STANDARD environment variable
# which should be set in the Dockerfile to be consistent with
# whatever the ROOT version used. (See Dockerfile for details.)
